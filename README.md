# Custom-Microsoft-Sentinel-KQL-Queries

Welcome! This repository contains a collection of Custom Microsoft KQLs queries that I’ve created over the years for reporting, threat hunting, detection engineering, and incident investigation.


Contents:

KQL — Microsoft Sentinel queries, dashboards, and analytics rules
MITRE ATT&CK mappings for some queries
Example outputs and logic explanations


Purpose:

This repo serves as a portfolio to showcase my experience building practical detections and hunting logic in real-world security operations environments. I also wanted to share my queries as they may be useful to others. Feel free to use these queries as you seem fit. 

Note: you may need to adjust some of the properties and values for it to work in your environment.
